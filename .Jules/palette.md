## 2025-02-18 - File Tab Unsaved Indicators
**Learning:** Users expect the "unsaved work" indicator (dot) in file tabs to transform into a close action (×) on hover. Keeping it as a static dot while functioning as a close button is confusing and potentially dangerous UX.
**Action:** Ensure interactive indicators (like unsaved dots) visually clearly communicate their "close" function on hover, mimicking established patterns in tools like VS Code.
